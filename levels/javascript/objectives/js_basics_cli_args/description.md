# For the Sake of Arguments

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a file called <code>divideByTwo.js</code></li>
  <li>Get a string of text passed as a command line argument and convert it to a number</li>
  <li>Divide that number by two</li>
  <li>Print the result using <code>console.log</code></li>

Beyond this barrier, you can see a stack of papers on the lead scientist's desk that must contain the password you are searching for. You're close to the key piece of information you need to help the scientists continue their ducktypium experiments!

You quickly find the malfunction that has caused this barrier to remain closed - a **script is missing** that performs a key mathematical calculation.

Create a file called `divideByTwo.js` in your code folder. Unlike other scripts you've written, this one must take a **command line argument** when you execute it, like this:

```bash
node divideByTwo.js 48
```

The script should take the number passed in, divide it by two, then print the result using `console.log`. This is a bit harder, so **we have some example code you can use as a starting point** in the Help section if you need it.

Once your code is ready, click the *HACK* button to override the laser command function.
