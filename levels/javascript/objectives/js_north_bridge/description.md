The botany lab is separated into several climate-controlled zones to study the effect of ducktypium on plant life. Each zone is connected by an energy bridge which prevents cross-contamination of habitats.

In order to reach the botanist, you'll need to reactivate the bridges, starting with this one.

## Extending the bridge

You examine the bridge controls and see that the activation routine is broken. You'll need to replace it in order to extend the bridge.

In your code folder, create a file called `northBridgeControl.js`. This program must take a single command line argument. If the argument is `EXTEND`, use `console.log` to print the text `Extending bridge!`. Your script shouldn't print anything at all unless the `EXTEND` argument is passed in. An example of how you would run this script is as follows:

```bash
node northBridgeControl.js EXTEND
```

See the **Help Tab** for more guidance on how to write a script that does this. Once your code behaves as described above, click the *HACK* button!
