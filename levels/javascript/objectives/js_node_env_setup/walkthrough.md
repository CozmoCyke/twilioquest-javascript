# Objective Help

To complete this challenge, you will first need to [install Node.js on your computer](https://www.nodejs.org). We will use this tool to execute JavaScript code that you will learn to write.

## Getting the full path to the Node.js runtime

After you install Node, the command line interface you use on your computer should have the `node` and `npm` commands available. From the command line on Mac and Linux, you should be able to use this command to get the full path to the Node runtime:

```bash
which node
```

On Windows in PowerShell, you could use this command:

```bash
Get-Command node.exe | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Definition
```

Once you have the full path, paste it into the text field on the right and click *HACK*.
