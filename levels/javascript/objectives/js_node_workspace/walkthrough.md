# Objective Help

To complete this challenge, create a folder on your computer to keep all your JavaScript code files for TwilioQuest. You can create the folder using your OS' graphical tools (Finder on Mac or Windows Explorer), or using a command prompt.

Once you have created a folder, paste the full path to this folder in the text field on the right. Let's say you created a new folder called `quest` to keep your JavaScript code. On Mac, a folder path might look like this:

`/Users/jane/quest`

On Windows, a folder path might look like this:

`C:\Users\jane\quest`

## Create a workspace from the command line

On both Mac and in PowerShell on Windows, you could create a workspace folder with the following commands. Type each command into the terminal one line at a time. Press *ENTER* after every line to execute the command. The text after the `#` signs below are not part of the commands - they are just there to explain the command that came before:

```bash
cd ~ # change directory to your home folder
mkdir quest # make a new folder called "quest"
cd quest # change directory to your new folder
pwd # print out the full path to the current folder
```

The last command, `pwd`, should print the full path you need to complete this objective.
