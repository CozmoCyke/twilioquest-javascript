# More practice with variables

Time for some extra practice [creating variables](https://javascript.info/variables)!

This time, you will need to **declare three variables** using some common [JavaScript data types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures). You'll learn more about these data types as you progress further into the lab.

To complete this objective, you will need to create a file called `chestConfiguration.js` in your code folder. Your code folder is located here:

`<%= env.TQ_JAVASCRIPT_WORKSPACE_PATH.value %>`

In this file, declare three variables with the names and values described in the objective. Here is an example you could use as a starting point, but you will need to change the variable names and values:

```js
const mulletLooksGood = false;
const meaningOfLife = 42;
const bestCharacter = 'Baby Yoda';

console.log('Mullets look good? ' + mulletLooksGood);
console.log('The meaning of life is: ' + meaningOfLife);
console.log('My favorite character in Star Wars is: ' + bestCharacter);
```

Once you have declared the variables as directed in the objective tab, click the *HACK* button.
