# The "Fun" in "Function"

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a file called <code>laserFunction.js</code></li>
  <li>Create a function called <code>getLaserSetting</code> that returns the string "OFF"</li>
  <li><em>HACK</em> when finished</li>
</ul>
</div>

Amid the destruction of the accident, you notice a new security barrier blocking off the interior wings of the lab. 

You examine the security of this barrier, and realize that it is powered by a **JavaScript function** that determines if the barrier's lasers are `"ON"` or `"OFF"`. You'll need to **override this function** to disable the laser barrier.

Create a file called `laserFunction.js` in your code folder. Inside this file, [create a JavaScript function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) called `getLaserSetting`. This function should **return** a [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) object with the value of `"OFF"`.

Once your code is ready, click the *HACK* button to override the laser command function.
