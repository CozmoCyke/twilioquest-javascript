# Git Your Act Together

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Initialize a git repository in your code folder</li>
  <li>Commit the current contents of your workspace</li>
</ul>
</div>

You use the **Flame of Open Source** to burn away some brush protecting this supply chest. It's currently locked, but it looks like you can open it again by demonstrating your knowledge of git.

Navigate to your JavaScript code folder, where you have been writing all your code for this mission. It's located here: 

`<%= env.TQ_JAVASCRIPT_WORKSPACE_PATH.value %>` 

Once there, initialize a new repository and commit the current contents:

```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```

This will initialize a git repository, add all of your example files, and commit them with a message. Click *HACK* after you've done this to validate your work!
