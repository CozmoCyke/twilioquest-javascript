# Override Security Settings

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a file called <code>laserConfiguration.js</code></li>
  <li>Declare a variable named <code>laserStatus</code> set to the string "OFF"</li>
  <li><em>HACK</em> when finished</li>
</ul>
</div>

You encounter another barrier blocking access to the lead scientist's office. After some investigation, you find out that it is configured with JavaScript code that locks the laser fence in the "ON" position. To drop the barrier, you'll need to **override this configuration with your own JavaScript code**.

Create a file called `laserConfiguration.js` in your code folder. Inside this file, declare a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) with the name `laserStatus` and set it to the [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) value `OFF`.

Once you have done this, click the *HACK* button to check your work and override the laser setting for this security barrier.
