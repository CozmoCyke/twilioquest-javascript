# Creating variables in JavaScript

The goal of this exercise is to practice [creating variables](https://javascript.info/variables) in your JavaScript code. Variables contain different types of data that your program can work with, like numbers, text, and more complex data. You can then refer to your data by name in your code using the variable names you created.

To complete this objective, you will need to create a file called `laserConfiguration.js` in your code folder. Your code folder is located here:

`<%= env.TQ_JAVASCRIPT_WORKSPACE_PATH.value %>`

In this file, declare a variable with the name and value described in the objective. Here is an example of creating a variable of a different name and value - you can use this as a starting point, but it will fail validation if you just copy/paste:

```js
const favoriteRobot = 'Cedric';
console.log('My favorite robot is ' + favoriteRobot);
```

Once you have declared a variable as directed in the objective tab, click the *HACK* button.
