# What's the Magic Word?

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a file called <code>sayPlease.js</code></li>
  <li>Add a line of code to print a friendly request (see below)</li>
  <li><em>HACK</em> when finished</li>
</ul>
</div>

You examine the barrier and determine that it can only be unlocked by the JavaScript Lab's IT department. You call up IT and speak with a technician named Glen. Glen reluctantly agrees to deactivate the barrier on one condition - you must ask him nicely.

To continue, you must **write a JavaScript program** that (nicely) asks Glen to open the barrier. Create a new JavaScript file named `sayPlease.js` in the folder you created earlier. For reference, it was:

`<%= env.TQ_JAVASCRIPT_WORKSPACE_PATH.value %>`

 Inside `sayPlease.js`, copy in the following line of JavaScript code:

```js
console.log('Glen, will you please open the barrier?');
```

Once you have written and tested code that will print this friendly request, click the *HACK* button. Hopefully Glen will find your request acceptable.
